Learning Singly Linked list
They are data structures just as arrays are datastructures with quite some differences as i will noote below:
	i)Singly Linked list do not allocate contiguous memory
	ii)Elments can be added indefinitely
	iii)We can easily remove an element
	iv)It contains nodes and these are structures with pointer to next node and value information
	v)Has Head which is the first node and tail which is the pointer to next that is equals to NULL

	vi)Singly Linked lists traverse only forward direction.
